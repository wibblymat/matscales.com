Hello developers,

[TODO: Tidy this paragraph up] Last week I was at BlinkOn 7 in Sunnyvale, California. BlinkOn is a gathering of all of the people that actually make Chrome, where they discuss what is coming next.

## Chrome release time!
Before I got to BlinkOn, though, it was Chrome release time. Chrome 56 became the new stable, and Chrome 57 became the new beta.

Generally speaking, our web developer relations team is mostly interested in when new features make it to beta. That's when a feature is probably baked enough for developers to go try it out, and is still early enough that we can get some good testing and feedback before releasing to stable.

This time around, though, the only beta feature that I had to deal with ended up not being ready to talk about in time for the beta blog post.

Instead, I had the pleasure of posting [5 WebVR case studies](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/tags/webvr) on our developer site. These were written by partners who had built stuff for WebVR while it was still in beta. Now that the feature has made it into Chrome stable we can use these to show how real businesses are being successful with this new technology that we've been telling everyone about.

WebVR is technically still experimental, of course, being released as an [Origin Trial](link me!), and is currently only available for DayDream. Expect to see even more cool stuff as the API matures and more headsets are supported.
