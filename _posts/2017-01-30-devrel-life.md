Hello developers!

My name is Mat, and I'm with Google's Web Developer Relations team. I'm starting a new series to share with you what I'm working on, what I've learned, and generally what's going on in the world of the web, and relating to web developers.

For my first post I'd like to start with a bit about what it is that I actually do. Developer relations is a pretty strange beast that can lead to all kinds of projects, but there are two basic tasks.

The first one is to work with internal software engineers - in my case, the engineers working on Chrome - on new developer features. Once the Chrome team starts work on a feature, we need to try it out and give them early feedback. Developer relations becomes "customer zero", the first people to learn it and build stuff with it. This lets us relate to developers by being developers. As a natural output of this process we end up with bug reports for the engineers, guides and talks for the developers who come after us, and maybe a library to make some particular use-case simpler.

For example, the recent guide to [Getting Started with WebVR](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/vr/getting-started-with-webvr/) is a write up of the notes that Paul and I made while figuring it out for ourselves. We're in the privileged position of being able to talk to the engineers directly when we are learning these new APIs. If we didn't produce the guide, everyone else would have to figure it out from just [reading the spec](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/), and nobody wants to have to do that!

The other half of developer relations is talking to developers. Not in the sense of "giving a talk" - that's in the first category. This is about being where developers are, and listening to what they are saying. It's about asking developers what they think about what is going on in their community. Sometimes we might respond by trying to clarify something that was confusing, or squash some misconception. Other times we hear actionable feedback that we can take straight to the engineering teams to make something better.

We are the Chrome team's voice in the community, and we are the community's voice in the Chrome team.

So, that was a lot of words, but what do I actually do each day? That's really the subject of the rest of this series. I currently expect to be working a lot with WebVR, WebGL 2.0, Web Assembly, SharedArrayBuffers, and other graphics and performance features. There are a lot of new toys coming for people making games on the web, and I'm going to start 2017 by looking into that.

Anyway, catch you next time!
