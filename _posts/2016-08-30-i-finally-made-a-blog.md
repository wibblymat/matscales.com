It's been many years since I had a personal blog, and I've never really had a
good excuse. After all, my job isn't just to make things on the web but to
encourage other people to do so too.

Anyway, I finally had too many things I wanted to write about, and too many
demos I wanted to show, so I found the 30-minutes it took to get a basic Github
pages blog going.

Hopefully the posts themselves will not take so long to come.
